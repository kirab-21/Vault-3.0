# Vault 3.0

Vault 3.0 is a D-App built using React for the frontend and Solidity for the smart contract.This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.

## Technology Used
- Solidity: Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- React: Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- IPFS: Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.

## Features
- Decentralized Storage: Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
- Smart Contract: Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
- Access Control: Users can grant or revoke access to their uploaded images to specific individuals through the smart contract.

## Future Improvements
- Better UI.
- Allow others to upload images or files/folder.
- Support other files like pdfs.
- Web Hosting
